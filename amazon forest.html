Things to Do in the Amazon
There are so many things to do and see on trips to the Amazon, especially if you’re interested in untouched nature and rare wildlife. Whether travelers opt for a relaxing river cruise or an eco-lodge immersed in the mighty jungle, Amazon trips offer plenty of opportunities to experience and learn about the locals, and the native flora and fauna. Some of our favorite Amazon Rainforest tour packages and excursions include kayaking through the submersed Amazon forest, fishing for piranha, tasting the local Amazonian cuisine, and learning from a multitude of educational briefs presented by local, expert guides.
Places to Visit on an Amazon Rainforest Vacation
The mighty jungle spans multiple countries, meaning there are plenty of places to visit in the Amazon Rainforest depending on the region in which you are traveling. There are areas of the Amazon in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and even Bolivia and Guyana. The Amazon River basin has an extensive network, with many tributaries and different types of forests, that harbor an abundance of flora and fauna. While the Amazon is shared by many countries, Brazil and Peru are the most popular points of entry.

In Brazil, Manaus is a common center point for rainforest excursions and in Peru, explorers enter through Iquitos or Puerto Maldonado. People from around the world travel to the Amazon through Brazil and Peru to revel in the beauty and sheer wildness of the jungle. Amazon trips are the perfect getaway from your regular life.

Manaus
The capital of the state of Amazonas, Manaus can be thought of as the capital for Amazon rainforest trips. The city itself is interesting having developed during the rubber boom of the late 19th century and being home to the famously opulent opera house. However, the real attraction lies in the surrounding rivers and forests. This is one of the most biodiverse regions of the planet, rich in wildlife from monkeys to pink river dolphins.

Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge is located approximately 2.5 hours from Manaus, Brazil. Travelers arrive at the lodge by boat or hydroplane. The lodge is located on the Anavilhanas Archipelago which has waters that are not conducive to insect life, meaning mosquitos are not an issue! There are 22 rooms of varying categories and also a swimming pool, TV room, reception lounge, and floating deck which is a rare luxury in this remote part of the world. Meals and activities are included in the cost of the lodge. At the naturalist guide’s direction, you’ll visit local communities, explore the jungle for wildlife, canoe or visit a community of pink river dolphins.

Puerto Maldonado & Iquitos
Peru has two main areas where tourists can visit Amazon rainforest – Puerto Maldonado and Iquitos. Puerto Maldonado is just a short flight from Cusco and thus very easily combined with a trip to Machu Picchu. Iquitos, in the north of Peru, is the world’s largest city that cannot be reached by road. Iquitos is on the River Amazon itself, while Puerto Maldonado is on the Madre de Dios River, a tributary of the Amazon. The rainforest around Puerto Maldonado has an excellent choice of high-quality jungle lodges including some that offer the chance to kayak, climb trees and fish for piranhas. Iquitos has the choice of lodges and luxury Amazon cruises.

Posadas Amazonas is located approximately 2 hours from the city of Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Travelers reach the lodge by a 30-minute van ride from the city and a 1.5-hour boat ride down the Tambopata River. This is a highly recommended lodge for travelers who want a real jungle experience. Nestled in the Tambopata rainforest, part of the greater Amazon rainforest, this lodge is eco-friendly and inside the communal reserve of the Ese Eja Native Community of Infierno. The lodge has 30 rooms in three different categories along with a kitchen, dining area, and relaxation lobby. The rooms are open to the jungle on one side, so you can hear and experience the forest from the comfort of your room. Meals and activities are included in the cost of the lodge. Activities range from boat expeditions to hiking trails that allow you to explore the jungle and encounter various wildlife and exotic flora. All activities are lead by naturalist guides.

Coca
Coca, Ecuador is the gateway city to the Amazon Rainforest. Sitting on the banks of the Napo River, Coca is the starting point for exploring the Ecuadorian Amazon. There are some excellent rainforest lodges which are reached by boat from this spot. Our favorite is La Selva Lodge and Spa.

La Selva Lodge and Spa in Ecuador is located approximately 3.5 hours from Coca, Ecuador. Travelers take a motorized boat for the majority of the way, then change into wooden canoes for the last 45 minutes through small creeks to reach a clearing on a black water lagoon, where the lodge sits. The lodge hosts various suite rooms, some overlooking the lagoon as well as a relaxation lobby, a dining area, and a spa. Meals and activities are included in the cost of the lodge. Activities range from jungle treks to bird watching to canoe trips to piranha fishing off the dock. You’ll be lead by naturalist guides and indigenous guides to go wildlife spotting.

Amazon Rainforest Tours from Colombia
The Colombian rainforest is the largest department of Colombia, located in the southern part of the country, with one of the sparsest populations of all Colombia. The capital of Leticia is the southern-most city of Colombia, and the jumping-off point for any visit to the Colombia rainforest, which gained its name from the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana, who wrote that he was attacked by tall women, reminiscent of the Amazonas of ancient Greek mythology. You can explore the depths of the Colombian rainforest on our Colombia Amazon Rainforest to Villavicencio Tour.

Amazon Rainforest Lodges vs. Amazon River Cruises
There are two main choices when it comes to Amazon Rainforest tours – either stay in a rainforest lodge or book an Amazon river cruise. The main starting points for Amazon cruises are Iquitos in Peru, Manaus in Brazil, and Coca in Ecuador. Typically trips to the Amazon by cruise are from three to seven nights in length and start and end in the same place. On Amazon river tours, the boat makes regular stops and offers exploration by smaller boats or excursions on land. A stay in an Amazon lodge is typically two to four nights long and involves guided walks, boat trips and often night fauna tours in the forest. Travelers who want an active Amazon rainforest trip can choose between a lodge stay, with daily excursions from one central point, or a cruise which anchors in different locations each day.

Packing List for trips to the Amazon Rainforest
Clothing for the Amazon
Footwear: Most lodges will provide you with rubber boots for walking the trails but ask your travel consultant to double-check this for you. If they don’t, it is important to bring strong footwear that is comfortable with strong ankle support and good grip. Waterproofing your shoes is recommended because you might encounter rain or mud. You’ll also want some comfortable rubber-soled shoes to wear around the lodge when you’re not out exploring.
Thick Socks: Wearing wool socks will keep moisture away from your feet while you’re trekking through the jungle in your rubber boots.
Layers: Bring layers and changes of clothing. For your excursions, you’ll need long sleeves, long pants, and high socks. This is for protection from bugs and the sun. You can get breathable quick-dry pants and long sleeve shirts (like the ones used for fishing) which will keep you comfortable so you can focus on the wildlife and flora. When you are relaxing in the lodge, you can wear t-shirts and shorts.
Extra Clothing: Remember that its quite humid in the Amazon so your clothing won’t always dry even if you hang it up. Most lodges do not have laundry services. So bring extra clothing!
Rain Gear: Bring a poncho or a waterproof jacket. Many lodges will let you buy these at their offices before you start out on your tour.
Headwear: Bring a hat or cap to keep the sun out and also your head dry and clean!
Swimsuit: You may have a chance to go swimming in the tributaries or even the Amazon River itself. Don’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity without a suit!
Additional Items for your Amazon Vacation
Backpack: bring a waterproof, sturdy backpack that you can carry your camera, water bottle, binoculars, etc while out on the trails or in the canoes / motorized boats.
Flashlight and Batteries: A flashlight is important for anyone enjoying the great outdoors, so bring plenty of batteries. A headlamp will work as well as it keeps your hands free. Many lodges will not have electricity throughout the lodge so in the case you need to find something in your bag at night, you’ll want to keep a light source handy. Also, many lodges will have a night walk activity and you can use the flashlight or headlamp to spot night creatures!
Insect Repellent: Your insect repellent should be at a minimum of 20% DEET. However, you can’t bring this on the plane to Puerto Maldonado or Iquitos, so ask your guide where to buy it when you arrive!
Bring your binoculars: Jungle animals are often spotted far away so you’ll want to get a good look!
Wet wipes and/or hand sanitizer
First Aid Kit: It’s always smart to bring along some pain medication, bandages, blister covers, etc. The guides will have first aid knowledge and some supplies but they are not allowed to administer pain medication.
Wristwatch: There is not always electricity in the rooms in the lodges, and you’ll need to know the time so that you can meet your guide for each activity!
Camera, batteries, and extra memory card: Photo opportunities may be around every corner so bring your camera and extra batteries and memory cards.
Plastic Bags: Plastic Bags can be useful for various reasons but the main reason is to keep dry clothes dry, and wet clothes away from other things in your backpack.
 Toiletries and Medicine: Anything that you think you may need in terms of toiletries or medicine you should bring with you. Some lodges will have a few basic items if you forget anything. Things like toothpaste, toothbrush, lotions, hairbrush, allergy medicine, antacids, etc. Leave the electronics at home though, you won’t be able to use a hairdryer or curling iron at the lodge.
 Your Passport: You must have your original passport with you. You can keep this in the safe in your room.
Popular Amazon Tours
There are few better forms of Amazon rainforest travel than the Tucano cruise: our travelers’ favorite. The Tucano is a true expedition cruise going further into the Amazon rainforest than any other cruise and has excellent jungle guides with great knowledge of the Amazon. Tours are in small groups of usually just seven or eight guests giving travelers an intimate experience. Enjoy the sights and sounds of the Amazon from the upper deck or relax in your private cabin while the motor yacht continues along the Rio Negro and the Rio Amazonas.

Visiting the Amazon can easily be combined with other destinations. Amazon rainforest trips can are available in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, and Brazil. This means that it is easy to combine trips to the Amazon with a number of other top South American destinations including Rio de Janeiro, Machu Picchu, and the Galapagos Islands. The best place to go in the Amazon may well depend on which other destinations you are interested in seeing. Contact us for more advice on our sample Amazon jungle tours or your exact tour package.

A Custom Amazon Rainforest Tour
Amazon vacation packages come in many forms, cruises or jungle lodge stays. Different levels of comfort are available and there is something to suit nearly any traveler. Amazon Rainforest vacations are one of our top areas of expertise, and we’ll be happy to discuss your plans in detail by phone, email, chat or text.

Visiting the Amazon FAQs
Thinking about an Amazon trip? Here’s a list of frequently asked questions we often hear from our guests. Visit our Amazon Vacation Planning page for in-depth Amazon travel tips.

When is the best time to visit the Amazon Rainforest?

For many reasons, the best time to visit the Amazon is from June – November. During this time, the Amazon Rainforest experiences its dry season – meaning the water levels are lower, allowing access to forested areas and greater opportunities for land-based exploration excursions.
However, it’s important to note that as the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon experiences approximately 250 days of rain a year, spanning all months. Despite having varying seasons, like the “wet” season (December – May), travelers should expect a few hours of light rain at any point in the year. The rain is what continues to keep the rainforests and its rare flora and fauna alive.

Is it safe to go to the Amazon rainforest?
Yes, traveling to the Amazon Rainforest is safe! In Brazil’s main center for visiting the Amazon – Manaus, you’ll always have guided activities with expert naturalist guides to help you navigate the jungle. Outside of town make sure you have all recommended vaccinations, according to your doctor and that you take a Malaria prophylaxis. Although along the Rio Negro, where most travelers go, there are very few mosquitoes!
Can you visit the Amazon rainforest?
Yes! In the past few years travel to the Amazon has become more and more commonplace. You can visit the Amazon by visiting a lodge in the forest or take an Amazon river cruise. The preferred route is along the Rio Negro, due to its lack of mosquitoes.
What can I do in the Amazon Rainforest?
All Amazon lodges and cruises offer jungle walks guided by local professionals to get to know the vegetation. Discover the importance of medicinal plants, spot vibrant macaws and parrots, and learn to identify the calls of rare animals. While listening to the sounds of the animals in the jungle is a common experience, actually spotting the fauna can be difficult. Travelers may consider the Pantanal wetlands for wildlife spotting, as it is less dense than the Amazon.
Piranha fishing is also very popular.

Local guides can also take you to different areas where other animal species can be seen, such as the pink river dolphins or macaws. Alligator (jacare) spotting at night is one of the most fascinating activities.

Is the Amazon dangerous?
In general, the Amazon Jungle is not dangerous for travelers! Animals in the Amazon are not aggressive, as there is plenty of food available. Even the aforementioned “alligator” is a “caiman,” the peaceful cousin of the crocodiles you have heard about from Australia and the Florida Everglades.
Your guide will always make you aware of toxic plants or spiders. Most guides are from the local communities, knowing well the healing properties of the plants that surround you. The one element to be aware of is Malaria: there is no vaccination, rather prophylaxis you take before traveling to the Amazon and stop taking as soon as you depart.

How do you get to the Amazon rainforest?
If visiting the Amazon in Brazil, you’ll get to the Amazon rainforest mostly by flying into Manaus, or for a more remote experience, by flying into Alta Floresta, with its luxurious lodge, or into Tefé for the most remote experience possible. In Peru, the main access points are Puerto Maldonado and Iquitos. In Bolivia, it is Rurrenabaque, Coca in Ecuador and Leticia in Colombia.
Is the Amazon good for animal watching? Are there better places for Animal watching?
Contrary to belief, the Amazon Rainforest is not the best place to see fauna, as the vegetation is mostly too dense. It is Pantanal Nature Tours that you’re in search of if wildlife is what most interests you. The Pantanal, just south of the Amazon, is an open wet savannah the size of Texas or France, making it much more ideal for animal viewing.
How can I visit the Amazon Rainforest?
Typically, you would stay at a lodge or cruise along the river. It depends on what kind of experience interests the traveler(s).
The advantage of a lodge is that your stay in the Amazon Rainforest can begin at any time, whereas cruises have set departure dates. While cruises offer plenty of departure dates, it can be challenging to be on a strict schedule. On the other hand, the advantage of a river cruise is that you see a vast extent of the rainforest, with different animals and vegetation, without needing to turn back after each excursion. Cruises also tend to include a stop at local communities where you can experience and learn about the lives of Amazonian locals.

Whether you experience the Amazon on a cruise ship or nestled in a lodge, you’re sure to have a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.


Are Amazon River Cruises worth it?
One advantage of taking an Amazon cruise is that you travel to many different locations within the Amazon. Relax as the vessel cruises to a myriad of areas, each with their own unique and varying vegetation and fauna.
There are two types of cruises available: the traditional, authentic experience with local guides and excellent comfort, operated by environmentalists. Alternatively, there are luxury boats run by international hotel chains that offer luxury, though making it more difficult to gain an authentic feel of the area.

Should I stay in a lodge?
As space is at a premium, cabins on boats tend to be tight. In contrast, lodges are accessible any time, especially those lodges nearer to Manaus (in Brazil) or close to Puerto Maldonado (Peru). Lodges are the ideal option if your travel plans do not allow you enough flexibility to go on a cruise. Also, lodges come for a greater variety of budgets.
How big is the Amazon Rainforest? What countries are the Amazon Rainforest in?
The Amazon Rainforest is ⅔ the size of Brazil or the continental US. However, the Rainforest is also shared by other countries as well. It stretches into the Guianas, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.
Is all of the Amazon Rainforest the same?
No – There are different areas with different flora and fauna. The main difference is caused by the altitude. Most of the Brazilian part is at sea-level or only slightly above it, whereas in Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, the rainforest sits on higher ground. The higher, the less dense the fauna is. Therefore, for example, if you are interested in birding, you would prefer the Peruvian Rainforest, as, due to the fauna being less dense, it is easier to spot birds. The Peruvian Amazon also offers some of the most luxurious river cruise ships such as the Aria.
<img src="C:\dhanush bca html project/a.jfif">

The Brazilian Amazon Rainforest offers travelers a wide range of lodges and cruises. Embark on a large cruise ship such as Hurtigruten or Iberostar, or a small, intimate cruise such as the Tucano. The Ecuadorian Amazon boasts Yasuni National Park, home to millions of species of plants, birds, insects, and mammals.
